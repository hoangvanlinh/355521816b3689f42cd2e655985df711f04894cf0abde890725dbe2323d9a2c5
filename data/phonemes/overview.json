    "vowels": {
      "short": {
        "explanation": "Short vowels are produced quickly with minimal muscular tension. They are typically unstressed and have a concise, less distinct vowel quality."
      },
      "long": {
        "explanation": "Long vowels have an extended duration and require more muscular tension during articulation. They are often used in minimal pairs to differentiate word meanings."
      },
      "diphthongs": {
        "explanation": "Diphthongs involve a smooth transition from one vowel quality to another within the same syllable, creating a dynamic, shifting sound."
      }
    },
    "consonants": {
      "fricatives": {
        "explanation": "Fricatives are produced by forcing air through a narrow channel, which creates continuous, turbulent airflow without completely stopping the air."
      },
      "plosives": {
        "explanation": "Plosives (or stops) are formed by completely blocking the airflow and then releasing it suddenly, which produces a burst of sound."
      },
      "nasals": {
        "explanation": "Nasals are articulated by closing the oral cavity and directing the airflow exclusively through the nasal passages, giving them a distinctive 'nasal' quality."
      },
      "approximants": {
        "explanation": "Approximants are produced with the articulators coming close together but not close enough to create significant friction. They offer smooth transitions and are less disruptive to airflow."
      },
      "affricates": {
        "explanation": "Affricates begin with a complete blockage of airflow, similar to plosives, and then transition into a fricative phase, combining characteristics of both sound types."
